# I/O ergonomics of popular languages

Working examples of how popular languages handle basic I/O and common serialization formats.

The examples are validated via a test suite that runs the examples in Docker and verifies expected behavior.

This project is not currently meant to be exhaustive in terms of languages, operating systems and I/O operations. The languages and I/O operations, etc are prioritized to support a commercial devtool product currently in stealth mode. That being said, contributions are very welcome.

The name `rosetta-io` is an hommage to [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) but is not affiliated.
